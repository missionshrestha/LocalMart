## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è 

There has been an upsurge in online transactions in Nepal as internet access has increased.
People are now more at ease buying and selling things online. Taking advantage of this
possibility, various online retailers such as Daraz, SastoDeal, and others have been able to
establish a market for vendors to sell their products online. However, based on the patterns of
these establishments, it appears that they are marketing foreign branded products rather than
Nepali products. According to several surveys, many foreigners and Nepali locals want to
buy original Nepali local products, however, there is no adequate platform for these Nepali
products to reach the market. Thus we prefer to carry out this project to provide a platform
for local Nepalese sellers to promote their products to national and worldwide markets.
